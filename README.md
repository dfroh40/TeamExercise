# Application Title: _TeamExercise_

## Configuration Settings

_Include any gradle or configuration settings that are required for your libraries or app to work_

Gradle must be configured for Mapbox Discover. Installation instructions can be found 
[here](https://docs.mapbox.com/android/search/guides/install/).

## API Key

_Let the course staff know whether or not your app requires an API Key and to whom it was sent
via email_

There is an API key called MAPBOX_DOWNLOADS_TOKEN which has been posted to EdStem in a private
post located [here](https://edstem.org/us/courses/38124/discussion/3181415).

## Reading the Code: 

_Detail how you would like the person who grades your app's code to do so. This could include 
giving them a UML diagram, or what is the best order to read the application files in_

Every other Activity inherits from TeamExerciseActivity. The rest can be read in any order,
although the implementation order is SettingsActivity, ProfileActivity, and then MainActivity.

## Other information

_Anything else you think is relevant for us to use when testing your code._
