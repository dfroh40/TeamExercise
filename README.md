# _TeamExercise_

## Configuration Settings

Gradle must be configured for Mapbox Discover. Installation instructions can be found 
[here](https://docs.mapbox.com/android/search/guides/install/).

## API Key

This app requires an API key called MAPBOX_DOWNLOADS_TOKEN. A Mapbox token can be obtained for free by creating a [Mapbox account](https://www.mapbox.com).
More details can be found [here](https://docs.mapbox.com/help/getting-started/access-tokens/).

## Reading the Code: 

Every other Activity inherits from TeamExerciseActivity. The rest can be read in any order,
although the implementation order is SettingsActivity, ProfileActivity, and then MainActivity.
